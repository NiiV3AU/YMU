# YMU
> A small Python GUI build with customtkinter, which allows you to download or update to the latest version of YimMenu

# How it Works
When you start YMU you are greeted with a modern looking GUI that displays two tabs, Download/Update and SHA256. You can download or update the dll in the Download/Update-tab. In the SHA256-tab you can view the sha256 of the local file and open the github release page of YimMenu to compare both strings with each other.

# How to Use
### Install the newest release here: 
| [Download YMU.exe](https://github.com/NiiV3AU/YMU/releases/latest/download/YMU.exe) |
| ------------- |

### Or simply run the Python File if you have all Requirements and Dependecies installed:
| [Download Source Code](https://github.com/NiiV3AU/YMU/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) | [Check Requirements and Dependencies](https://github.com/NiiV3AU/YMU?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements-and-dependencies) |
| ------------- | ------------- |


# Use Cases
Very limited, gets the file as fast as simply visiting [YimMenu](https://yim.gta.menu/) in your Browser and download it manually.
> *'psst*~ it looks cooler :)


# Why then, you ask?
The Project teached me new things as using threading for a more responsive gui, downloading files in python and improved my overall python skills. I also uploaded the project on GitHub to get some feedback on my code, so I would appreciate it if you would take your time reviewing my code on flaws etc.
