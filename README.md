# YMU
>[!NOTE]
> **NEW** in `v1.0.1` ↦ Injection in the new Inject-Tab
>
> **NEXT** in `v1.0.2` ↦ View the Changelog of YimMenu in a new Changelog-Tab

# How it Works
When you start YMU you are greeted with a modern looking GUI that displays four tabs, Download, Update, SHA256 and Inject. You can download the dll in the Download-Tab or update it in the Update-Tab. In the SHA256-Tab you can view the sha256 of the local file and open the github release page of YimMenu to compare both strings with each other. The new Inject-Tab provides a button which injects the YimMenu.

# How to Use
### Install the newest release here: 
| [Download YMU.exe](https://github.com/NiiV3AU/YMU/releases/latest/download/YMU.exe) |
| ------------- |

### Or simply run the Python File if you have all Requirements and Dependecies installed:
| [Download Source Code](https://github.com/NiiV3AU/YMU/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) | [Check Requirements and Dependencies](https://github.com/NiiV3AU/YMU?tab=readme-ov-file#requirements-and-dependencies) |
| ------------- | ------------- |


# Use Cases
Very limited, gets the file as fast as simply visiting [YimMenu](https://yim.gta.menu/) in your Browser and download it manually.
> *'psst*~ it looks cooler :)
> 
> *'ahem*~ also your browser can't inject it, right?


# Why then, you ask?
The Project teached me new things as using threading for a more responsive gui, downloading files in python and improved my overall python skills. I also uploaded the project on GitHub to get some feedback on my code, so I would appreciate it if you would take your time reviewing my code on flaws etc.
